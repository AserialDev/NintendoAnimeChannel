After seen that, launch "start.py" (you need to have Python)

after you launch it, put the IPV4 Adress of the computer with the moflex and 3dst files,

After that, put the port 8000, and an url will be present, open it in your browser, and navigate in your computer files, and do an right click
on the moflex or 3dst file, and copy the adress.

And in your "debugcatalog", put all the links that you want, it's easy to use don't worry!

what is debugcatalog? 
- It's the catalog of your Anime Channel server, here is the path: \luma\titles\0004000000141200\romfs\bootapp\resources\scripts\content\debugcatalog.lua

When you finish to config the catalog and all, put the folder "luma" in the root of your sd card. 

That's all, don't forgot to follow on Github!
